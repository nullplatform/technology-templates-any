    Nullplatform "Any Technology" Template
    <br>
</h2>

This is a minimalistic sample on how you can create an application on arbitrary technology.
In particular, we're spinning up an image that contains an echo server.
You can check *Echo Server* documentation [here](https://ealenn.github.io/Echo-Server/).

## How do I modify this template to build my own application?

1. Change the Dockerfile to run the application / binary that you are building
2. Deploy your application in nullplatform
